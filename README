This Repository is for Juniper Slax scripts.

To use the scripts you need to:

1) put the script in the /var/db/scripts directory under op, commit or event directory.

2) configure the juniper router/switch to point to the script:
for example:
system {
   scripts {
    	  op {
        	file my-op-script.slax;
          }
    }
}

USAGE

you need to execute an op script as follows:

router>op <script-name> <argument>
