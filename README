This is Juniper op script in Slax.

To use the script you need to:

1) put the script in the /var/db/scripts/op directory.

2) configure the juniper router/switch to point to the script:
for example:
system {
   scripts {
    	  op {
        	file error.slax;
          }
    }
}

USAGE

you need to execute an op script as follows:

router>op error

It is hard to find out which interfaces has errors when you issue as 'show interface xxx extensive | grep errors'

This script easily can tell you which interfaces has errors on it. 

For example:

router> op error 
Error on output errors:  xe-1/0/0 on carrier-transitions 1
Error on output errors:  et-1/1/0 on carrier-transitions 1
Error on output errors:  xe-1/2/0 on carrier-transitions 1
Error on input errors:  xe-1/2/3 on input-errors 3
Error on input errors:  xe-1/2/3 on framing-errors 3
Error on output errors:  xe-2/0/0 on carrier-transitions 8
Error on input errors:  xe-2/0/1 on input-errors 53
Error on input errors:  xe-2/0/1 on framing-errors 53
Error on input errors:  xe-2/0/3 on input-errors 751
Error on input errors:  xe-2/0/3 on framing-errors 751
Error on output errors:  et-11/0/0 on carrier-transitions 22
